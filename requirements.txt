# Requirements lower bounds listed here are our best effort to keep them up to

# you find any incorrect lower bounds, let us know or propose a fix.

# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order
# of appearance. Changing the order has an impact on the overall integration
# process, which may cause wedges in the gate later.
